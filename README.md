## What I Learned
The next step in my journey to learn more about iOS development was building on my work with APIs. I wanted to see what more I could accomplish with APIs, so for this application I built a Twitter client. While building this application, I learned how to save data to the application, so that users don't need to login after each restart. I also wanted to improve my design/UI skills, so I tried to resemble Twitter's UI as much with this application to make it more user-friendly.

## Video Walkthrough
Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

**NOTE**: When cloning this application, there are a few pieces of information you must fill in in order to build and run properly. In a separate Swift file (i.e. Constants.swift), create 2 constant variables: consumerKey and consumerSecret. These 2 constants are used to communicate with the Twitter API. After configuring these constants, you can successfully run this Twitter client!
